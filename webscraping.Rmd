You can find the source code for this file in the class repository. The direct link is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlamadon/econ-34430/master/src/static-labor-supply.Rmd).

Let's start with studying static labor supply. We will consider the decision of the agent under the following rule:

$$
\max_{c,h} \frac{c^{1+\eta}}{1+\eta} - \beta \frac{h^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}\\
\text{s.t. } c = \rho \cdot w\cdot h -r + \mu - \beta_0 \cdot 1[h>0] \\ 
$$
The individual takes his wage $w$ as given, he chooses hours of work $h$ and consumption $c$ subject to a given non labor income $\mu$ as well as a tax regime defined by $\rho,r$. $\beta_0$ is a fixed cost associated with working.

We note already that the non labor income can control for dynamic labor supply since we can have $\mu= b_t - (1+r)b_{t+1}$. This is part of a larger maximization problem where the agents choose optimaly $b_t$ over time. We will get there next time.

## Interior solution

The first order conditions give us $w(wh +r - \mu)^\eta = \beta h^\gamma$. There is no closed-form but we can very quickly find an interior solution by using Newton maximization on the function $f(x) = w(wh +r - \mu)^\eta - \beta h^\gamma$. We iterate on 

$$x \leftarrow x - f(x)/f'x)$$.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
